# Top 10 List of Week 05

1. [What is Virtual Memory ?](https://searchstorage.techtarget.com/definition/virtual-memory)<br>
This page will help you solve the question above. It also tell you how virtual memory works.

2. [COW - Copy On Write](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/copy-on-write/)<br>
This page explain about copy on write, where COW is a resource management technique.
One of its main use is in the implementation of the fork system call in which it shares the virtual memory of the OS.

3. [Page Replacement Algorithm](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/page-replacement-algorithms-in-operating-systems/)<br>
This page tells some page replacement algorithms (FIFO, Optimal Page Replacement, and Least Recently Used). It also gives  us some example to make our understanding clearer.

4. [Least Recently Algorithm Page Replacement](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/program-for-least-recently-used-lru-page-replacement-algorithm/)<br>
Least Recently Used (LRU) algorithm is a Greedy algorithm where the page to be replaced is least recently used. For more example, just check it out.

5. [Second Chance Page Replacement Policy](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/second-chance-or-clock-page-replacement-policy/)<br>
In the Second Chance page replacement policy, the candidate pages for removal are considered in a round robin matter, 
and a page that has been accessed between consecutive considerations will not be replaced.

6. [Allocating kernel memory](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/operating-system-allocating-kernel-memory-buddy-system-slab-system/)<br>
In this page, it explains about Two strategies for managing free memory that is assigned to kernel processes Buddy system and Slab allocation.

7. [Buddy System](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/buddy-system-memory-allocation-technique/)<br>
The buddy system is a memory allocation and management algorithm that manages memory in power of two increments. It also gives us the pros and cons of using it.

8. [Page Fault](http://digitalthinkerhelp.com/page-fault-in-os-operating-system-what-is-page-fault-handling/)<br>
The explaination is pretty clear about page fault and also it provides page fault terminology for us

9. [Thrashing](https://www.studytonight.com/operating-system/thrashing-in-operating-system)<br>
This page gives a great explanation about thrashing, causes of thrashing, effect of thrashing, and some techniques used to handle thrashing

10. [Virtual Memory in OS](https://www.guru99.com/virtual-memory-in-operating-system.html)<br>
A great summarize about Virtual Memory. It gives us a short yet clear explanation.
