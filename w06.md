# Top 10 List of Week 06

1. [Process](https://www.studytonight.com/operating-system/operating-system-processes)<br>
This page gives a clear explanation about Process. A process is a program in execution which then forms the basis of all computation.
Process memory is diveded into 4 sections : Text, Data, Heap, and Stack. This page also gives me an insight about the difference between 
Process and program.

2. [Scheduling](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/os_process_scheduling.htm)<br>
The process scheduling is the activity of the process manager that handles the removal of the running process from the CPU and 
the selection of another process on the basis of a particular strategy.

3. [State Process Model](https://t4tutorials.com/five-state-process-model-in-operating-systems/)<br>
Process contains 5 states that are involved in the cycle of process New, Ready, Running, Blocked, Exit. Simple and straightforward explanation.

4. [Introduction to Synchronization](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-process-synchronization/)<br>
On the basis of synchronization, processes are categorized as one of the following two types:
Independent Process ( Execution of one process does not affects the execution of other processes ) 
Cooperative Process ( Execution of one process affects the execution of other processes ) 

5. [Threads](https://www.cs.uic.edu/~jbell/CourseNotes/OperatingSystems/4_Threads.html)<br>
Great note about threads.Quite long but it gives a great expanation about threads 

6. [Benefits of Multithreading](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/benefits-of-multithreading-in-operating-system/)<br>
There are 4 major catagories the benefits of multithreading : Responsiveness, Resource Sharing, Economy, and Scalability. 
For more explanation of each benefit, just check this site. 

7. [Intro to Concurrent Programming](https://www.toptal.com/software/introduction-to-concurrent-programming)<br>
What is concurrent programing? Simply described, itâ€™s when you are doing more than one thing at the same time. 
Not to be confused with parallelism, concurrency is when multiple sequences of operations are run in overlapping periods of time. 

8. [Difference between Concurrency and Parallelism](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-concurrency-and-parallelism/)<br>
Concurrency is the task of running and managing the multiple computations at the same time.
While parallelism is the task of running multiple computations simultaneously.
For more point, just check this site.

9. [Fork](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/fork-system-call/)<br>
Fork system call is used for creating a new process, which is called child process, 
which runs concurrently with the process that makes the fork() call (parent process)

10. [Fork() function](https://youtu.be/cex9XrZCU14)<br>
A great video about fork in C just check it out
