# Top 10 List of Week 08

1. [CPU Scheduling](https://www.studytonight.com/operating-system/cpu-scheduling)<br>
CPU scheduling is a process that allows one process to use the CPU while the execution of another process is on hold(in waiting state) due to unavailability of any resource like I/O etc, thereby making full use of CPU. By reading this site, we will get a light explanation about CPU Scheduling.

2. [Preemptive and non Preemptive](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/preemptive-and-non-preemptive-scheduling/)<br>
This site gives me an explanation about the difference between preemptive and non preemptive. The key difference and comparison chart that provided really helps me to know the difference better. 

3. [FCFS Scheduling](https://www.guru99.com/fcfs-scheduling.html)<br>
First Come First Serve (FCFS) is an operating system scheduling algorithm that automatically executes queued requests and processes in order of their arrival. It provides an example that go through the process how to implement FCFS method.

4. [SJF](https://www.studytonight.com/operating-system/shortest-job-first)<br>
Shortest Job First scheduling works on the process with the shortest burst time or duration first. This site provides a clear example that really easy to understand.

5. [Round Robin](https://www.guru99.com/round-robin-scheduling-example.html)<br>
It's quite unique where the name of this algorithm comes from the round-robin principle, where each person gets an equal share of something in turns.This sites explain the characteristic of round robin scheduling and a great and clear example.

6. [Priority Scheduling](https://www.guru99.com/priority-scheduling-program.html)<br>
Priority Scheduling is a method that is based on priority.The scheduler will selects the tasks to work as per the priority. 
The step by step example really helps me to understand how priority works. This site also provides a summary to check our understanding.

7. [Multilevel Queue Scheduling](https://www.studytonight.com/operating-system/multilevel-queue-scheduling)<br>
Multilevel Queue is another class of scheduling algorithms which processes are easily classified into different groups.

8. [Terms in CPU Scheduling](https://afteracademy.com/blog/what-is-burst-arrival-exit-response-waiting-turnaround-time-and-throughput)<br>
This site will explain some confusing terms in CPU scheduling like Burst time, Arrival time, Exit time, Waiting time, Response time, Turnaround time, and throughput.It also gives us some example to make everything clear.

9. [UMA NUMA](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-uniform-memory-access-uma-and-non-uniform-memory-access-numa/)<br>
It gives us the definition about (Uniform Memory Access) UMA and (Non-uniform Memory Access) NUMA. The illustration and table of difference really help me to understand. 

10. [Scheduling Algorithm (Video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6QjVDyGgSE)<br>
more question - solution that helps us to ensure our understanding. Just check this amazing video.
