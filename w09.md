# Top 10 List of Week 09

1. [Volatile - Non Volatile](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-volatile-memory-and-non-volatile-memory/amp/)
This site explain the difference between volatile and non volatile memory. The table really helps me to see the difference

2. [Mass Storage Structure](https://www.cs.uic.edu/~jbell/CourseNotes/OperatingSystems/10_MassStorage.html)
Great summarization about mass storage structure  where it gives us a complete explanation mass 
storage struture. 

3. [Disk Schedulling Algorithm](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.geeksforgeeks.org/disk-scheduling-algorithms/)
Beside disk schedulling algorithm,it also explains some reason why disk schedulling is important and duscuss some important terms.
The graph that provide in this site really helps me to understand how to get total seek time each disk schedulling algorithms.

4. [SCAN](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/scan-elevator-disk-scheduling-algorithms/)
This site gives explanation about SCAN algorithm. It also explain the advantage and disadvantage of SCAN.
The given example really helps us to understand it. 

5. [SWAP space Management](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/swap-space-management-in-operating-system/)
It gives explanation about swapping, swap space, swap space mamangement and swap space use. Just check it out.

6. [RAID](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/raid-redundant-arrays-of-independent-disks/)
RAID, or “Redundant Arrays of Independent Disks” is a technique which makes use of a combination of multiple disks instead of using a single disk 
for increased performance, data redundancy or both.

7. [Cloud Storage](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/cloud-storage)
This site gives you an amazing explanation about clud storage.It contains explanation about cloud storage, how does it work, the pros and cons, and some examples.
Really need to check it out.

8. [Difference between FCFS and SCAN](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-fcfs-and-scan-disk-scheduling-algorithms/)
The table provided in this site is really helpful in understanding the difference between FCFS and SCAN
.Beside that, it also provide an example for FCFS and SCAN.

9. [How do hard drives work ?](https://youtu.be/wteUW2sL7bc)
This interesting video will show us how do hard drives work. The animation really helps us to know better about hard drives.

10. [Magnetic disk structure](https://prepinsta.com/operating-systems/magnetic-disk-structure)
A short but clear explanation about magnetic disk structure.It also provides explanation about 
transfer rate andrandom access time.
