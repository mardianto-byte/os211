# Top 10 List of Week 04

1. [Memory Management Unit](https://er.yuvayana.org/what-is-memory-management-unit-mmu/)<br>
What is MMU ? MMU is short for the memory management unit. It is the hardware part that oversees virtual memory system. Regularly, the MMU is a piece of the CPU; however, in certain structures it is a different chip.
The MMU incorporates a modest quantity of memory that holds a table coordinating virtual address to physical address.


2. [Virtual vs Physical addresses](http://web.cs.wpi.edu/~cs3013/c06/week4-paging.pdf)<br>
It gives an explanation about virtual and physical addresses where Physical addresses refer to hardware addresses of physical memory and
Virtual addresses refer to the virtual store viewed by the process.For more information, check it out.


3. [Big Endian and Little Endian](https://chortle.ccsu.edu/AssemblyTutorial/Chapter-15/ass15_3.html)<br>
A short but clear explanation about the difference between Big Endian and  Little Endian. The illustration that given also helps me to get clear more about the explanation.


4. [Endianness explained with an egg](https://youtu.be/NcaiHcBvDR4)<br>
This video gives Unique explanation about Big Endian and Little Endian with an egg of Liliput in Gullver's travels. 


5. [Library in Linux](https://www.tecmint.com/understanding-shared-libraries-in-linux/)<br>
Linux supports 2 classes of libraries,static libraries are bound to a program statically at compile time and dynamic/shared libraries are loaded when a program is launched and loaded into memory and binding occurs at run time.


6. [Memory Allocation](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-dynamic-memory-allocation/)<br>
This page gives some explanation about dynamic memory allocation.There are many reasons and advantage of allocating memory dynamically. One of them is Dynamically created lists insertions and deletions can be done very easily just by the manipulation of addresses whereas in case of statically allocated memory insertions and deletions lead to more movements and wastage of memory.
To find out more, check this page.

7. [Introduction to pointers in C](https://youtu.be/h-HBipu_1P0)<br>
watch this video to get information about pointers using C. It gives a clear explanation with a great example that make you easy to understand.


8. [Working with pointers](https://youtu.be/X1DcpcgSUXw)<br>
This video is a continuation of the video on number 7, where it gives an example with code in C, just check this great video. 


9. [Paging](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/paging-in-operating-system/)<br>
Gives explanation about paging and example. The illustration helps me to understand what it mean.


10. [Paging Technique](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rf5Jc61ArM)<br>
A great video about paging. It gives a simple explanation that really easy to understand
